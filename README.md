# EE-183DA-Foward-and-Inverse-Kinematic-for-Kinematic-Chains

This is the first lab for my EE 183DA course (Robotic System Design). 
The goal of this lab is to understand the forward and inverse kinematics
of a simple robotic design. This lab requires us to go out in the world
and find a kinematic linkage that can be represented by a kinematic chain.
We needed to extract the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters to calculate the
trasnformation between operational space parameters and the joint space 
paramenters. We also needed to analyze that transformation to determine
its inverse kinematics. Lastly, we needed to implement the inverse
kinematics and use our implementation to simulate the sample mission of
robot. Contributers to the code are me and Sumedh Vijay.
